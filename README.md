# Energy_Consumption_Investigate_Capstone_Project

## Data Source

Kaggle data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather

A copy is also available in the repository under the `data` folder

## Project Objective

This project analyzes and forecasts energy consumption, energy generation, and weather time-series data. Specifically, it aims to:

- Develop predictive models to forecast the future energy consumption using time-series weather and historical energy usage data
- Characterizes the temporal patterns and trends in the energy consumption time series
- Estimate the contributions of different energy sources required to meet the future demands

## Practical Questions Investigated

To address our objectives, the following questions are investigated via data analysis and mathematical modelling:

- Periodicity and Seasonality: What periodic or seasonal patterns can be observed in energy consumption?
- Energy Generation Dynamics: How do the contributions of different energy sources vary over time, and in response to changes in demand and weather conditions?
- Weather-Energy Relationships: How do weather variables correlate with energy consumption and generation?
- Forecasting Modelling: Which model parameters, features and statistical methodologies provide more accurate prediction for energy consumption, and what explains their performance?
